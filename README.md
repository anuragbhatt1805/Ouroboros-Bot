## 🌟 About the Project

Ouroboros Bot🤖 is a telegram bot developed for Computer Science & Engineering Department, HKBK College of Engineering.

It was developed for few of the following reasons:
 - It was developed for easier communication between students and faculty and department heads.
 - It helps students to ask personal doubts about the project, about the mentorship, and many more directly to related faculty.
 - It also helps students & faculty to register any complaints or issues related to the department, which can be improvised or changed for better development of students carrer and college.
 - For further updates, there is an option for feedback which can be given by the users of the telegram bot to help developers how they can improvise it add new features required for the department.

Teach Stack Used in Project is described later in the documentation.

## ⚒️ Tech Stack

### Telegram BotFather

[BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) is the one bot to rule them all on Telegram.
 - It is used to create new bot accounts and manage your existing bots.
 - It provides an easy-to-use interface to create bots, generate and regenerate tokens, and set up bot commands.
 - It's a key component in the Telegram ecosystem, enabling the extension of Telegram's functionality through the creation of custom bots.
BotFather is an essential tool for anyone looking to create and manage bots on Telegram, providing a streamlined process for bot creation and management.


### Telegram API

The [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/) is a set of functions provided by Telegram that developers can use to interact with Telegram's servers.
 - It allows developers to send and receive messages, manage groups, and perform various other tasks.
 - It's a key component in extending the functionality of Telegram beyond its standard features.
The API is a powerful tool for creating custom Telegram clients or bots, providing a way to tap into the vast user base of Telegram for various applications.


### Telegram Bots

[Telegram Bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots) are special accounts that do not require an additional phone number to set up.
 - These bots can interact with users via inline requests, commands, and messages.
 - They are capable of many things - they can teach, play, search, broadcast, remind, connect, integrate with other services, or even pass commands to the Internet of Things.
 - They're a powerful tool for extending the functionality of Telegram, allowing developers to create new ways of interacting with the platform.


### Python

[Python](https://docs.python.org/3.10/) is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
 - It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
 - Its extensive standard library and rich ecosystem of third-party packages make it a versatile language for developers.
Python is widely used in various domains like web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more.


### python-telegram-bot

[python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) is a Python wrapper for the Telegram Bot API.
 - It allows developers to create and manage Telegram bots with Python easily.
 - It's compatible with Python versions from 3.6 to 3.10, which makes it a versatile tool for creating bots.
 - It also includes a number of convenience features for handling different types of updates from Telegram.
The library provides a pure Python interface for the Telegram Bot API.


### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
 - It extends the SQL language with a robust set of features to safely store and scale complicated data workloads.
 - It's highly extensible and standards-compliant, making it a popular choice for many web applications.
PostgreSQL comes with many features aimed to help developers build applications, administrators to protect data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your data no matter how big or small the dataset.


### SQLAlchemy

[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python.
 - It provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access.
 - It's a comprehensive tool for working with relational databases in Python.
SQLAlchemy's philosophy is SQL databases behave less like object collections as the scale gets larger, and more like arrays of tuples, and accommodates both styles.


### Azure

[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is Microsoft's cloud computing platform, providing a variety of services including those for computing, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.
 - It's a comprehensive suite of cloud services that developers and IT professionals use to build, deploy, and manage applications through Microsoft-managed data centers.

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL

[Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/) is a fully managed database service provided by Microsoft's Azure.
 - It offers high-performance, highly available PostgreSQL databases in the cloud. - It supports a wide range of developer tools and integrates seamlessly with Azure services allowing you to focus on app development rather than managing database infrastructure.
 - It's a scalable solution with built-in security, including network isolation and encryption.

### nohup for Python Deployment

`nohup` is a POSIX command to ignore the HUP (hangup) signal, enabling the program to continue running after the user has logged out.
 - In Python deployment, `nohup` can be used to run your Python application in the background, even after the terminal has been closed.
 - It's particularly useful for long-running Python scripts on remote servers, ensuring that the script execution isn't halted when the session ends.
